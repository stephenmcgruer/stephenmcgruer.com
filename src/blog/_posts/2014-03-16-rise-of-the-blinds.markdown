We have blinds!

Now, I'm sure some of you (hi Dad!) just looked at those photos and went "those
don't look right...". You would be correct. Unfortunately, this lovely new
building comes with a lovely new steel framework... which makes it a complete
pain to hang things from walls. The setup you see above is the result of two
days of carefully prodding around our walls, divining where the steel stops and
where we can actually place anchors. Unfortunately, this meant that the blinds
don't *fully* cover the windows. Still, they do work - we can actually make the
bedroom dark! (Also, to be fair to the walls, the middle blind mostly suffers
from my inability to measure properly.)

Moving on from our adventures in housing construction, we had a more sedate
adventure on Saturday, exploring some of the nearby town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus,_Ontario">Fergus</a>. As those who recognize the name
(or followed the wikipedia link) might have guessed, Fergus has quite a strong
Scottish background. So much so, that they even have an import shop selling
proper Scottish goods!

Unfortunately I didn't buy anything because the prices were just a bit too
crazy for me (seriously, look at those DVDs. $35 is about &pound;20 - a bit
much for some *dreadful* comedy ;).) Still, it was actually a really
comfortable feeling, to walk into a shop and instantly recognize everything.
Makes you start to understand expat stereotypes a bit more. I mean, they even
had potato scones and square sausages, so I am looking forward to a real
breakfast sometime in the near future!

We had hoped to visit the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elora_Gorge">Elora Gorge</a> while in
Fergus, but apparently just a few feet of snow (ok, 3 or 4...) is considered
'unsafe', and it was closed. Slightly dejected, we were about to head for home
when my better half made a snap decision (along with an... enthusiastic bit of
maneuvering), and stopped off at a car park near the local river. Lo and
behold, we found ourselves on a scenic 20 minute stroll above the river,
freezing, but enjoying the view immensely. (Pictures on Facebook.)

That's about it for this week, I think. The hour grows late once more, so
time to retire to bed, and look only a *little* shamefully at my windows
and their poorly hung blinds. Until next time, adios!
