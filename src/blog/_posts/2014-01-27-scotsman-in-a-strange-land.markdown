Welcome! Dear reader, you have arrived at the first in hopefully a ongoing
series of posts I intend to write about my life here in Canada.

Not withstanding my egotism in assuming that anyone is actually interested, nor
the fact that I am over a decade late to the 'personal blog' idea, I hope that
at the very least this will give me some excuse to practice the subtle art of
communication<sup>1</sup>. My intention is to publish updates weekly, on
Sundays (yes, I know today is Monday. Start as you don't mean to go on, right?)
Perhaps over time, other posts will wind their way into this tale, but for now
I think weekly will do.

So, to start off, why don't we take a tour of my humble abode here in Canada?
As the cold and the dark of winter press at our windows (well, mine; I believe
it's approximately 10&deg;C and raining in Scotland these days), what better
way to pass the time than to listen to my dulcet tones?

Fasctinating stuff, no? The apartment is, of course, still rather bare. Indeed,
the list of furniture to be purchased seems to increase daily. Desks, curtains,
sofas, spare beds, ... Really, I need a cheaper hobby than decorating my
apartment.

Speaking of which, a recap of the week is perhaps called for. Much of it, of
course, was spent on this new fangled concept called 'working'. Or perhaps not
so new now; I have now been here for almost an entire quarter. Long enough that
wrestling with poorly documented hardware seems like an average day... likely
because it is :). (For the uninformed, I currently work
[here](http://www.google.ca/about/jobs/locations/waterloo/), working on
[this](https://fiber.google.com/about/). It's pretty awesome.)

Jasmine was away last week, doing residency interviews in Halifax and Montreal,
but we made up for that with a busy weekend. On Friday night we went to see
[American Hustle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1800241/) (not bad; good acting
but a bit of a lacklustre plot). Saturday found us at the local mall in the
morning (<b>so</b> North American!), then we went ice skating in the evening
followed by dinner at [The Works](http://www.worksburger.com/). Perhaps not
unexpected for a country that is currently -15&deg;C and is always obsessed
with hockey, but there are free outdoor ice rinks all over the place, and well
maintained (unlike the roads...). Finally, on Sunday we did a little more
skating, a bit more shopping actually (but grocery related, this time), and
finally, we made ourselves a good old fashioned apple pie<sup>2</sup>:

Well, that brings us to the end of our first tale. Perhaps, if you were not so
bored as to be currently deleting me from your favourite choice of social
network, you might join me again next week, and marvel as I immediately miss my
first deadline.

<p class="footnote">
1: And yes, the irony of that impressively run-on sentence did not escape me.
As I said, I do require some practice.

2: Ok, so technically it's an Apple Crumble Pie, which is slightly less
traditional. But still delicious.
