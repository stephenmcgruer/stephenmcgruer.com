And so we make it to the second blog post in this little series of mine.
Amazingly, we may even make the Sunday deadline (or perhaps not; my clock
currently says 10:50pm...)

Helpfully (for my deadline), it has been a quiet week, at least for myself.
Jasmine has been busier, doing residency interviews with two more medical
schools - which seem to have gone well, which is good. After her second
interview we celebrated by going to
[Beertown](http://www.beertown.ca/). We've tried before, but their waiting
times have driven us off. Alas, it seemed to us that the waiting times were not
representative of the quality; while they did have an excellent selection of
beer (I tried the [delirium
tremens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_Tremens_(beer))), the food was
fairly poor quality. Still, you live and learn!

Apart from that, Saturday morning began with more baking! A favourite of
mine - [Nutella Banana
Muffins](http://www.thenovicechefblog.com/2013/01/nutella-banana-swirl-muffins/):

The rest of the weekend was taken up with PC building. As of last week, all of
the components are finally here! Unfortunately, the peripherals have not,
necessitating that the build take place at work. For the interested, my new
build:

 * Intel Core i5 4770k
 * CM Hyper Evo 212
 * 8GB DDR3 RAM
 * GeForce GTX 780
 * Asus Z87 Extreme4 MB
 * Samsung 840 Evo, 256 GB SSD
 * Seagate Barracuda 1TB HDD
 * Corsair 400R case
 * SeaSonic 620W PSU

Or, for more fun, pictures!

Anyway, I think that's all for this week. Not my best post, I'm afraid, but on
the upside we did technically make the Sunday deadline (11:35 exactly!).
Hopefully next weekend I will have more interesting tales to tell... (but given
that my monitor should arrive by then, perhaps not!).
