Hello, blog readers! Another week over, and this time I have remembered to blog
about it. It seems I'm managing about a 60% success rate - 9 weeks, 6 blog posts
so far. Looking at that number now really drives home how long I've been here.
As of today, its been 162 days since the officer at Canadian immigration stamped
my passport. *162* days. Just over 23 weeks. Nearly 5 and a half months. Crazy,
eh?

Anyway, onto what I've been up to in the last 14 days! Last weekend was very quiet,
which contributed to my lack of blogpost. The BH (better half) was working the
weekend shift, so I spent most of the weekend relaxing and playing my latest
choice in videogame - <a href="http://www.titanfall.com/">Titanfall</a>. Oh, and
ample time in the kitchen:

Carrot cake! (Photo taken in the microkitchen at work. There's only so much cake
two people can eat...)

Chocolate cake!

And cottage pie! (That's what you call sheperd's pie when you make it with beef,
right? An interesting discovery of last week - Canadian shops generally *do not
sell lamb*. There's so much flat ground here that they tend to only farm cattle,
so any lamb you manage to track down has usually been imported from New Zealand -
and comes with a hefty price tag!)

Moving onto this weekend, things have been a bit busier. On Friday evening I
joined a few colleagues and some of their friends to take part in (of all
things!) a charity dodgeball tournament in London (Ontario, not England).
Held in benefit of the <a href="http://www.sunshine.ca/">Sunshine Foundation</a>,
we all had a lot of fun following the 5 D's of Dodgeball (for those not in the know,
that's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ASBsQfXnw">dodge, dip, dive, duck,
and dodge</a>.) At the end of the evening we came out third of seven; not bad given
that half the team (yours truly included) had only ever played dodgeball a handful
of times before in their lives! Of course, the downside of that lack of experience
is that I spent the rest of the weekend grouching around with strongly complaining
muscles! It seems that while running and swimming may have kept my muscles alive,
they were certainly not ready for short bursts of intensive activity. So I shall
clearly have to do more in the future.

Sore muscles not withstanding, on Saturday the BH and I decided to engage our 'nerd'
muscles as we attended <a href="http://www.nerdfest2014.eventbrite.ca">Nerd Fest 2014</a>.
As the name might suggest, this was an afternoon of nerdy activities: board games,
video games (including a <a href="http://www.artemis.eochu.com/">Star Trek bridge simulator</a>
and a change to try an <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus Rift</a>), arts and
crafts, and a bunch of talks on topics ranging from the history of censorship in Hollywood
to Shark attacks! There were also a number of 'quirky' food vendors, including a
'Mashed Potato Bar' and a taste of home in the
<a href="http://www.greatbritishbake.com/">'Great British Bake'</a> (turned out to be
completely unrelated to the BBC TV series...). Lots of fun, and seemed popular so hopefully
it (and we) will be back next year!

Well, that pretty much brings us to the end of the weekend. Today (Sunday) was
a quieter day, as we did a quick 'spring clean' of the apartment (despite the
still sub-zero weather, it is *technically* spring...), and then went out for
dinner at the <a href="http://thebauerkitchen.ca/">Bauer Kitchen</a> (our
analysis: nice, but probably not worth the slightly expensive price. The search
for a truly 'worth it' upmarket restaurant continues!)

So until next week (or perhaps the week after?); goodnight!
