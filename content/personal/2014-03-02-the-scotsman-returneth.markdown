Title:  The Scotsman Returneth
Date:   2014-03-02 22:00:00

Hello, dear reader! I have returned, and am ready to bore you once more with
excruciating details about my simple life here in the great white north. It
has been a slightly short week, as I only landed back in the country on
Wednesday evening. Still, we managed to fit in a few activities.

On Thursday evening, jet-lagged though I was, we dropped by a friends house for
boardgames and beer (and pizza). A lot of fun was had, despite my inability to
win at either

or
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29368/last-night-on-earth-the-zombie-game">Last Night on Earth</a>.
Being rebellious spirits, it was past midnight before we once more chanced the
-15 &deg; weather and headed home. Here now jet lag played a helping hand, as
despite the late bedtime I was wide awake the next morning for work!

The weekend was largely split between two events; chili on Saturday, and IKEA
on Sunday. I'm a big fan of Smitten Kitchen's recipe for
<a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/09/beef-chili-sour-cream-and-cheddar-biscuits/">sour cream and cheddar biscuits</a>,
which go great with a nice big pot of chili. I even snapped some pictures,
though they turned out a bit more... orange than reality.

On Sunday we returned to face the mighty IKEA once again. It was a
surprisingly straightforward, if expensive, trip, and we managed to get a
couch, a desk, a TV stand (albeit we have no TV yet), and curtain
poles/blinds for all of our windows (though no curtains!). Alas, while the
desk and TV stand were easily assembled, we ran into plasterboard problems
when trying to put up the blinds. (The matter has been raised to a more
experienced body. Hi Dad!). Still, overall a success I feel, and I have finally
been able to remove my computer from the dining table and give it a proper
home:

The couch didn't fit in the car, so should be arriving sometime tomorrow.

Unfortunately that brings us to the end of this week's update. Time now to
retire to bed, and look shamefully at my windows and their complete lack of
blinds. Until next week, adios!
