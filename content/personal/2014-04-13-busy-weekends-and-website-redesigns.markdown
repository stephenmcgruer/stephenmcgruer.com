Title:  Busy weekends and website redesigns
Date:   2014-04-13 23:18:00

Howdy, blog readers, and welcome to my newly 'redesigned' website! Air quotes
required, of course, because little of this is actually *my* design. I finally
conceded this weekend that I was never going to get around to properly
designing my website, so instead I spent a few hours and switched to using
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/), with the
[Octopress theme](https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme) (like
Wordpress, but for software geeks.) The result is something that I think is
much more pleasant on the eyes, even if a bit boring.

So, what have I been up to over the last two weeks? Rather busy, actually!
Let's start with last weekend (the 4th-6th). We kicked off the weekend in a
celebratory fashion, as it was the BH's graduation formal. Slightly strange, as
she is not graduating for another month and a half, but what can you do. The
even was fun, if over-priced ($70 a head!) - dinner, dancing, and a late-night
poutine bar (for those not familiar with the concept, poutine is a combination
of fries, gravy, and... cheese curds. Yeah, Canadians are a bit weird.) There
was also a photo booth available for anything from serious to silly photos;
and yes, there are now a few photos floating about of me with a tiger hat on.
May they never see the light of <s>Facebook</s> day.

On the Saturday the BH and I put our geek chops back on and went to our
local [International Tabletop Day](http://www.tabletopday.com/) event. We had
a good time exploring some new games we'd not come across before -
[Wasabi](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33154/wasabi) (a zany sushi-based
matching tiles game),
[Love Letter](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter) (race other
players to deliver your love letter to the princess), and
[Eclipse](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse) (explore the universe,
populate planets, and get your behind kicked by far more experienced players).
I also won a game in a silent auction, which was not bad (to be fair, there
wasn't much competition, but hey, it was for charity.) Once board-gaming was
finished, we grabbed a very quick dinner and headed off to our next appointment
- Toronto!

Yup, crazy that we are, we thought it would be a sensible idea to have an
all-day event in KW on the Saturday, and Toronto on the Sunday. But a good
friend of mine from back home was in Toronto for a conference, so needs must.
As is typical, I believe, the TTC had closed part of the subway on Sunday, so
my trip into town involved both a 30 minute subway journey (from Finch to
Bloor-Yonge), and a 15 minute walk (down to College). Luckily the weather here
has taken a turn for the lovely recently, and it was warm(ish) and sunny out.
It was also worth it for the catch up; we wandered around the
[ROM](http://www.rom.on.ca/en) for a while, and then had lunch at the
[Kensington Cornerstone](http://kensingtoncornerstone.com/). Although a little
strange, the Cornerstone serves fairly good food, and is entirely gluten-free.
For general eating I wouldn't seek it out especially, but if you're eating with
someone who is celiac then its great to have somewhere where they can eat
*anything* on the menu.

Continuing on the 'weather is suddenly nice' theme, this past week it was warm
enough that we managed for the first time to spend some time on our balcony!
It is very strange to go from -5&deg; one week to 20&deg; the next, but
I am definitely not complaining.

This weekend (the 11th-13th) was a little quieter. A colleague of mine hosted a
board-game on Friday evening, where I finally got to play
[Alhambra](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6249/alhambra). Alhambra is a
card-collecting, tile-building game that I have had my eye on for a while now,
so I was happy to try it out. My verdict - ok, but not 'must buy', so my wallet
is safe for now. Also, I only came 3rd, which must mean it's a dreadful game!

For dinner on Saturday, we decided to try something a little out of our comfort
zones, and found a small Xinjiang restaurant on the outskirts of KW. Xinjiang
is a region in the north-west of China, and it's cuisine is heavily influenced
by its neighboring Mongolia. In practice, this seemed to mean lamb and spices!
The food was very good (hand pulled noodles == *amazing*), but likely due to
our inexperience we ended up ordering two very spicy dishes; bàn miàn (pictured
below) and a very very hot beef brisket soup (not pictured, was already eaten
by that point). We will definitely be back - but will probably take a little
more care in ordering!

To finish up our weekend (and this blog post), we headed back to the [Clay and
Glass Gallery](http://www.theclayandglass.ca) on Sunday for another turn
playing with some clay. Since it'll be a few weeks until we're able to paint
and fire our products, I will instead treat you to a picture of what we made
last time we went (which I apparently never mentioned on this blog - for
shame!).

And with that, I will sign off and go to bed. Until next time, ciao!
