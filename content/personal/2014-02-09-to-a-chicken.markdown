As may be evident by my poetical entrance, the primary note of interest this
week was my foray into the roasting of a chicken. Amazingly, for all my
22-and-a-bit years on this planet, I have actually never roasted a chicken. Or
rather, __had__ never. After five years of being responsible for my own
cooking, I finally managed to take something like this:

And turn it into something like this:

I was even ambitious enough to attempt to make soup with the carcass!

Given that the details of chicken-roasting would most likely not make for a
thrilling read, I will the temptation to describe it in excruciating detail.
Instead, perhaps my learnings will make for better reading:

  1. When you are instructed to sprinkle salt on the chicken 'liberally',
     there is such a thing as too liberal.
  2. Meat thermometers are useful things, but be careful where you place them.
     (The picture above is actually not the final product! The thermometer
     was sitting wrong and so read too high a temperature too soon. Luckily,
     I noticed.)
  3. Making soup from chicken remains is not as easy as my father always made
     it look. Although edible, my attempt has turned out _way_ too sweet for
     my tastes. Similarly to salt, there is such a thing as too much carrot.

So, there we have it; another step on the road to being a 'grown up'. Perhaps
not the most successful, but as they say, practice makes perfect. That, and
begging advice from your father before your second attempt (which I indeed
to do.)

In other news this week, my monitor finally arrived on Thursday! With Jas being
away at the moment (more on that in a second), I took the opportunity this
weekend to set myself up at the dining table:

Just another reminder that I really ought to get back to outfitting my
apartment with furniture, a desk included. I'm sure I'll get around to it.
Someday.  Perhaps once Jas returns from her adventures in Toronto, where she is
currently doing one of her last electives before exam season and her subsequent
graduation from medical school! Much like my university years, her time at
medical school seems to have flown by - at least from my perspective.

Unfortunately, this brings us to the end of this week's update. The onset of a
light cold has left me loathe to do much this weekend, and is also doing quite
well at restricting the effort I spend on this post. (It's not much of anything
- a sore throat, blocked sinuses - but any excuse to just slob around!) So
instead I shall made the quite-fast-becoming habitual hope that next week's
efforts will be of more interest and higher quality. For now, I take myself off
to bed, with a glass of water and a pile of tissue (gross!).
